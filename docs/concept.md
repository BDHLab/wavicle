###Introduction
Wavicle is a web app which is meant to be installed in the web server so it can be used by visitors of the web server. A regular visitor may make use of the services created by Wavicle and an administrative user may administer the services.

It’s designed to create and manage content. The contents may be merged together to form something much more complex which is usually known as a service or simply, content combination.

###Content
Content is anything that can be regarded as a single object. For example:
- web page
- checklist item
- video
- image
- theme

Content can use other contents as well. For example:
a webpage can use a theme to define its looks. Theme simply provides styling codes to the webpage to use.

###Combining Content
As mentioned earlier, some contents may be merged to form something much more complex. For example:
- web pages can be merged together to create a web site
- checklist items can be merged together to create summary of progress (something indicating progress)
- videos can be merged together to form a playlist
- images can be merged together to create a gallery.

###Content Combination
Anything formed by merging contents is known as content combination. For example:
- web site
- summary of progress
- playlist
- gallery

Content combinations can be used by each other. For example:
- a website may contain a playlist, gallery and summary of progress
- a playlist can use contents of a gallery (images) as icons for its videos

###Extensions
Extensions allow you to create and manage specific content. They add functionalities to Wavicle and allows it to do more specialized tasks. For example:
- Page extension allows you to create and manage pages
- Theme extension allows you to create and manage themes
- Checklist extension allows you to create and manage checklist items

So, in other words, if Wavicle can’t do something and you want it to be able to do so, for example, managing notes, you can get it done by installing the right extension if only such extension exists.

###Possibilities
Let’s assume a person installed Wavicle in her server, which can be accessed by anyone through the internet. She is installed it for these purposes:
- creating pages which are articles on “Organic Chemistry”
- collecting videos which shows people how to deduce shapes of organic compounds, etc
- collecting images of shapes of organic compounds, etc
- collecting notes on formulae of organic molecules
She can use Wavicle and right set of extensions to create an educational website which presents a playlist and a gallery. Moreover, she can place the notes, images and videos on her pages.
 The above example is just the possibilities of an average user.
Wavicle, in fact, can be used to make a whole new web app, by installing extension to create, manage and combine scripts.
You can have threads combined to make a forum, obviously you can give privileges to your registered visitors to create new thread.
A thread won’t be complete without posts. Post is another type of content and belongs to a specific thread. This is an example of nesting content. Here, you’re simply nesting posts inside threads.
